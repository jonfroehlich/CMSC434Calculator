This is the demo code for the YouTube video [Rapidly Prototyping a Calculator App in Android](https://youtu.be/2-mmH_nOE9Q)
This video provides an introduction to creating an interactive application in Android Studio for my Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction class at the University of Maryland. The introduction assumes very little previous knowledge of Android but experience with Java.

The video covers:
1. How to use Android Studio's drag-and-drop WYSIWYG interface along with the declarative XML interface to build user interfaces
2. How to use built-in widgets such as Grid Layouts, Buttons, and Text Views
3. How to interface between the WYSIWYG/XML editors and Java
4. How to style your interface
5. How to use Toast and a few other tips.

I recorded the video in 2048Ã—1280 so you should watch it in high resolution.
