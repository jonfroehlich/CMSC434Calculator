This repo includes code for a simple, interactive Android calculator made in Android Studio.

The code was developed in a YouTube tutorial video called [Rapidly Prototyping a Calculator App in Android](https://youtu.be/2-mmH_nOE9Q). I suggest watching the video if you want to better understand how the calculator was developed and various design decisions. The video tutorial assumes very little previous knowledge of Android but experience with Java.

The video covers:
1. How to use Android Studio's drag-and-drop WYSIWYG interface along with the declarative XML interface to build user interfaces
2. How to use built-in widgets such as Grid Layouts, Buttons, and Text Views
3. How to interface between the WYSIWYG/XML editors and Java
4. How to style your interface
5. How to use Toast and a few other tips.

I recorded the video in 2048Ã—1280 so you should watch it in high resolution.

This code and video was originally developed for my Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction class at the University of Maryland:
